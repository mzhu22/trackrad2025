The above YAML block configures the app for deployment on HuggingFace Spaces.

# Labeling app

This is a Gradio-based application for viewing and labeling MR sequences from the TrackRAD2025 Grand Challenge.

## Running locally

This project uses the [uv package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

To run the app locally, first install depedencies:

```
uv sync
```

Then:

```
uv run gradio app.py
```

Note that submitting labeled images will not work, as they require pushing to a private HuggingFace dataset. But for the sake of demonstration, the app should otherwise work locally.
